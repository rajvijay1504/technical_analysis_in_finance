# technical_analysis_in_finance
 Unlocking the secrets of market trends and investment patterns, leveraging technical analysis to navigate the complexities of finance with precision and insight.

In this project, I have:
1. Developed and implemented trading strategies using Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators for NIFTY 50 stocks.
2. Fetched and processed financial data from Yahoo Finance API, including historical stock prices, and conducted technical analysis.
3. Calculated and visualized trading signals and performance metrics, achieving cumulative profit analysis and strategy evaluation.
4. Utilized sentiment analysis using data from Google API to predict stock performance, specifically for HDFC Bank, gaining familiarity with sentiment analysis techniques.
5. Addressed data availability challenges by using recent sentiment data (18 July 2024 to 24 July 2024) and identified limitations due to short-term data availability.
6. Achieved cumulative profits using RSI strategy with a maximum profit factor of 1.957, and evaluated MACD strategy with a profit factor up to 1.143, providing insights into the effectiveness of these technical indicators.
7. Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and YFinance for data handling, analysis, and visualization.
